# **The Complex Systems Approach ** {-}

Complexity research transcends the boundaries between the classical scientific disciplines and is a hot topic in physics, mathematics, biology, economy as well as psychology and the life sciences. This course will discuss techniques that allow for the study of human behaviour from the perspective of the Complexity Sciences, specifically, the study of complex physical systems that are alive and display complex adaptive behaviour such as learning, development and creativity. Contrary to what the term “complex” might suggest, complexity research is often about finding simple models/explanations that are able to describe a wide range of qualitatively different behavioural phenomena. “Complex” generally refers to the object of study: Complex systems are composed of many constituent parts that interact with one another across many different temporal and spatial scales to generate behaviour at the level of the system as a whole, in complex systems “everything is interacting with everything”. 

The idea behind many methods for studying the dynamics of complex systems is to exploit the fact that “everything is interacting” and quantify the degree of periodicity, nonlinearity, context sensitivity or resistance to perturbation (resilience) of system behaviour. Applications in the behavioural sciences are very diverse and concern analyses of continuous time or trial series data such as response times, heart rate variability or EEG to assess proficiency of skills, or health and well-being. Complexity methods can also be used for the analysis of categorical data, such as behaviour observation of dyadic interactions (client-therapist, child-caregiver), daily experience sampling, social and symptom networks. The complex systems approach to behavioural science often overlaps with the idiographical approach of “the science of the individual”, that is, the goal is not to generalise properties or regularities to universal or statistical laws that hold at the level of infinitely large populations, but to apply general principles and universal laws that govern the adaptive behaviour of all complex systems to a specific case, in a specific context, at a specific moment in time.

The main focus of the course will be hands-on data-analysis. Practical sessions will follow after a lecture session in which a specific technique will be introduced.

We will cover the following topics:     

*	Theoretical background of phase transitions (self-organised criticality), synchronisation (coupling dynamics) and resilience (resistance to perturbation) in complex dynamical systems and networks.    
*	Simple models of linear and nonlinear dynamical behaviour (Linear & logistic growth, Predator-Prey dynamics, Deterministic chaos),    
*	Analysis of (multi-) scale dependence in time and trial series (Entropy, Relative roughness, Standardized Dispersion Analysis, (multi-fractal) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis).   
*	Quantification of temporal patterns in time and trial series including dyadic interactions (Phase Space Reconstruction, [Cross-] Recurrence Quantification Analysis).    
*	Dynamical network analyses for univariate (recurrence networks) and multivariate time series (multiplex recurrence networks).    
*	Using the method of surrogate data analysis (constrained realisations of time series data) to test hypotheses about the nature of the data generating process.      


## Learning outcomes {-}

After completing a course you will able to:   

*	Simulate linear, nonlinear and coupled dynamics using simple models.
*	Conduct (multi-fractal) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and related techniques to quantify global and local scaling relations.
*	Conduct Recurrence Quantification Analysis and related techniques to quantify temporal patterns, synchronisation and coupling direction.
*	Conduct analyses on (multiplex) Recurrence Networks to quantify structure and dynamics of (multivariate) time series.

Naturally the (depth of) topics discussed will be limited by the duration of the course.


### Level of participant {-}
*	Master
*	PhD
*	Post-doc
*	Professional

### For whom are these courses designed? {-}
The courses are designed for all researchers who are interested in acquiring hands-on experience with applying research methods and analytic techniques to study human behaviour from the perspective of Complexity Science. Prior knowledge is not required, some experience using R is recommended.

### Admission requirements {-}
During the course we will mostly be using the R statistical software environment. Basic experience with R is highly recommended (e.g. installing packages, calling functions that run analyses, handling and plotting data). We also offer a module for the Jamovi software with which the most basic analyses can be conducted. Using Jamovi does not require any prior knowledge of R, but you will not be able to use more advanced features of certain analyses.

Please bring your own laptop to the course. We will help you to install the necessary open source software, all of which can run on Windows, MacOS and most likely also on common varieties of Unix/Linux. The specifications for your computer are simply this: You need to be able to connect to a wireless network (wifi) and you should be able to install and run R (https://www.r-project.org). In addition, you might want to be able to use RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com) and Jamovi (https://www.jamovi.org).

If you do not have the resources to bring a laptop that meets the required specifications, please let us know in advance so we can try to find an alternative solution.

Links to online materials on specific topics will be provided (*Study Materials*) that may provide additional explanation and information about key concepts. These materials are not obligatory, but highly recommended to study at least once.

### Notes about this book and the assignments {-}

The texts in the chapters of this book are somewhat of a work in progress, and are intended as a rough introductory guide to accompany the lectures. Sometimes, you will notice a paragraph or chapter rather resembles a set of lecture notes instead of a self-contained text. Do not hesitate to let us know if you think anything is unclear or too far out of context for you to understand.

An essential part of the course are the assignments that are available online and are linked to from the course pages, for example: https://complexity-methods.github.io/courses/helsinki-workshop-2020/day1_2/


```{block2, imp, type='rmdimportant'}
 The text inside these blocks provides important information about the course, the assignments, or the exam.
```


```{block2, ken, type='rmdkennen'}
 The text inside these blocks provides examples, or, information about a topic you should pay close attentiont to and try to understand.
```


```{block2, note, type='rmdnote'}
 The text inside these blocks provides a note, a comment, or observation.
```


```{block2, think, type='rmdselfThink'}
The content in these blocks are often questions about a topic, or, suggestions about connections between different topics discussed in the book and the assignments. You should decide for yourself if you need to dig deeper to answer the questions or if you want to discuss the content. One way to find an answer or start a discussion is to open a thread in the discussion forum on Blackboard labelled *ThinkBox*.

# **Some Notes on Using `R`** {-}

You have probably heard many people say they should invest more time and effort to learn to use the `R` software environment for statistical computing... *and they were right*. However, what they probably meant to say is: "I tried it, but it's so damned complicated, I gave up"... *and they were right*. That is, they were right to note that this is not a point and click tool designed to accommodate any user. It was built for the niche market of scientists who use statistics, but in that segment it's actually the most useful tool I have encountered so far. 


## **New to `R`?** {-}

Now that your struggles with getting a grip on `R` are fully acknowledged in advance, let's try to avoid the 'giving up' from happening. Try to follow these steps to get started:   

1. **Get `R` and add some user comfort:** Install the latest [`R` software](http://www.r-project.org) *and* install a user interface like [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com)... *It's all free!* An R interface will make some things easier, e.g., searching and installing packages from repositories. R Studio will also add functionality, like git/svn version control, project management and more, like the tools to create html pages like this one (`knitr` and `Rmarkdown`). Another source of user comfort are the `packages`. `R` comes with some basic packages installed, but you'll soon need to fit generalised linear mixture models, or visualise social networks using graph theory and that means you'll be searching for packages that allow you to do such things. A good place to start *package hunting* are the [CRAN task view](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) pages.

2. **Learn by running example `code`:** Copy the commands in the `code` blocks you find on this page, or any other tutorial or help files (e.g., Rob Kabacoff's [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net)). Paste them into an `.R` script file in the script (or, source) editor. In R Studio You can run code by pressing `cmd` + `enter` when the cursor is on a single single line, or you can run multiple lines at once by selecting them first. If you get stuck remember that there are expert `R` users who probably have answered your question already when it was posted on a forum. Search for example through the Stack overflow site for [questions tagged with `R`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r))

3. **Examine what happens... when you tell `R` to make something happen:** `R` stores variables (anything from numeric data to functions) in an `Environment`. There are in fact many different environments, but we'll focus on the main workspace for the current `R` session. If you run the command `x <- 1+1`, a variable `x` will appear in the `Environment` with the value `2` assigned to it. Examining what happens in the `Environment` is not the same as examining the output of a statistical analysis. Output in `R` will appear in the `Console` window. Note that in a basic set-up each new `R` session starts with an empty `Environment`. If you need data in another session, you can save the entire `Environment`, or just some selected variables, to a file (`.RData`).

4. **Learn about the properties of `R` objects:** Think of objects as containers designed for specific content. One way to characterize the different objects in `R` is by how picky they are about the content you can assign it. There are objects that hold `character` and `numeric` type data, a `matrix` for numeric data organised in rows and columns, a `data.frame` is a matrix that allows different data types in columns, and least picky of all is the `list` object. It can carry any other object, you can have a `list` of which item 1 is an entire `data.frame` and item 2 is just a `character` vector of the letter `R`. The most difficult thing to master is how to efficiently work with these objects, how to assign values and query contents.

5. **Avoid repeating yourself:** The `R` language has some amazing properties that allow execution of many repetitive algorithmic operations using just a few lines of code at speeds up to warp 10. Naturally, you'll need to be at least half Vulcan to master these features properly and I catch myself copying code when I shouldn't on a daily basis. The first thing you will struggle with are the `apply` functions. These functions pass the contents of a `list` object to a function. Suppose we need to calculate the means of column variables in 40 different SPSS `.sav` files stored in the folder `DAT`. With the `foreign` package loaded we can execute the following commands:   
`data <- lapply(dir("/DAT/",pattern=".sav$"),read.spss)`        
`out  <- sapply(data,colMeans)`       
The first command applies read.spss to all files with a `.sav` extension found in the folder `/DAT`. It creates a data frame for each file which are all stored as elements of the list `data`. The second line applies the function `colMeans` to each element of `data` and puts the combined results in a matrix with dataset ID as columns (1-40), dataset variables as rows and the calculated column means as cells. This is just the beginning of the `R` magic, wait 'till you learn how to write functions that can create functions.

## **Not new to `R`?** {-}

If you have been using `R` for a while, but do not consider yourself a master yet, I recommend learning to use the [**tidyverse**](http://tidyverse.org) packages and the accompanying web-book [**R for data scientists**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

* Welcome to the **tidyverse**:
      + [Install the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)
      + [Learn how to use the tidyverse](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)
      + [Learn how to use the tidyverse to do statistics](http://moderndive.com)

      + [How to make R purrr](http://purrr.tidyverse.org)


## **Time series analyses in R** {-}

In this book you can find some tips on plotting time series (see section [**R: The time series object**](#plotTS)) and we will be using package [`casnet`](https://fredhasselman.github.io/casnet/) as our main tool for analyses. However, if you really want a deep dive into everything related to time series in R be sure to check the CRAN task view on time series: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html     


### casnet {-}

To install `casnet` you need to have package `devtools` or `remotes` installed and call the following code from the commands line:

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("FredHasselman/casnet", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# or equivalently
library(devtools)
remotes::install_github("FredHasselman/casnet", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)
```

If all goes well this should install the package and all the packages it depends on.
If the vignette build fails, don't worry, you can access them through the [casnet website](https://fredhasselman.com/casnet/) under *Articles*.


## **We used `R`!** {-}

This text was transformed to `HTML`, `PDF` en `ePUB` using `bookdown`[@R-bookdown] in [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com), the graphical user interface of the statistical language [**R**](https://www.r-project.org) [@R-base]. `bookdown` makes use of the `R` version of [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) called [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) [@R-rmarkdown], together with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) [@R-knitr] and [pandoc](http://pandoc.org). 

We'll use some web applications made in [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) [@R-shiny] 

Other `R` packages used are: `DT` [@R-DT], `htmlTable` [@R-htmlTable], `plyr` [@R-plyr], `dplyr` [@R-dplyr],`tidyr` [@R-tidyr], `png` [@R-png], `rio` [@R-rio].
